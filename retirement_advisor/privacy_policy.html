    Experience: </strong>From time to time we may request information from you to assist us in
    improving our <span id="span_id_type">Mobile App</span>, such as demographic information or your
    particular preferences.</p>

<p><strong><br>Article 7 - THE PERSONAL DATA WE RECEIVE AUTOMATICALLY:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cookies:</strong> We may collect information from you through automatic tracking systems
    (such as information about your browsing preferences) as well as through information that you
    volunteer to us (such as information that you provide during a registration process or at other
    times while using the <span id="span_id_type">Mobile App</span>, as described above).</p>
<p>For example, we use cookies to make your browsing experience easier and more intuitive: cookies
    are small strings of text used to store some information that may concern the user, his or her
    preferences or the device they are using to access the Internet (such as a computer, tablet, or
    mobile phone). Cookies are mainly used to adapt the operation of the site to your expectations,
    offering a more personalized browsing experience and memorizing the choices you made
    previously.</p>
<p>A cookie consists of a reduced set of data transferred to your browser from a web server and it
    can only be read by the server that made the transfer. This is not executable code and does not
    transmit viruses.</p>
<p>Cookies do not record or store any Personal Data. If you want, you can prevent the use of
    cookies, but then you may not be able to use our <span id="span_id_type">Mobile App</span> as we
    intend. To proceed without changing the options related to cookies, simply continue to use our
    <span id="span_id_type">Mobile App</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Technical cookies: </strong>Technical cookies, which can also
    sometimes be called HTML cookies, are used for navigation and to facilitate your access to and
    use of the site. They are necessary for the transmission of communications on the network or to
    supply services requested by you. The use of technical cookies allows the safe and efficient use
    of the site.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You can manage or request the general deactivation or cancelation of
    cookies through your browser. If you do this though, please be advised this action might slow
    down or prevent access to some parts of the site.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cookies may also be retransmitted by an analytics or statistics
    provider to collect aggregated information on the number of users and how they visit the <span
            id="span_id_type">Mobile App</span>. These are also considered technical cookies when
    they operate as described.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Temporary session cookies are deleted automatically at the end of the
    browsing session - these are mostly used to identify you and ensure that you don't have to log
    in each time - whereas permanent cookies remain active longer than just one particular
    session.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Support in configuring your browser: </strong>You can manage
    cookie through the settings of your browser on your device. However, deleting cookies from your
    browser may remove the preferences you have set for this <span
